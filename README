ObliqueStrategies is a Processing tool for creating useful dilemmas in your work. Run it whenever you hit a slow spot to give yourself something new to think about.

I created ObliqueStrategies using Eclipse, so it should work properly if you clone it into an existing Eclipse workspace. Export a .jar with the resources to Documents/Processing/tools/ObliqueTool/tool/ObliqueTool.jar when you want to use it.

To use the precompiled tool, grab the archive from the downloads page ( http://github.com/sansumbrella/Processing-ObliqueStrategies/downloads ). Place it inside a folder named tools/ in your sketchbook folder, then unzip it. You should see Oblique Strategies in your tools menu the next time you launch Processing.
